🚀 Elevvo Machine Learning Internship

This repository documents all tasks, projects, and learning materials completed during the Elevvo Machine Learning Internship.
The internship focuses on solving real-world problems with machine learning techniques, ranging from regression and clustering to recommendation systems and forecasting.

📌 Tasks
Task 1 – Student Score Prediction

Goal: Predict students’ exam scores based on study hours and related factors.

Steps: Data cleaning, visualization, train/test split, build linear regression model, evaluate performance.

Bonus: Apply polynomial regression and test feature combinations (e.g., sleep, participation).

Dataset: Student Performance Factors (Kaggle).

Skills: Regression, evaluation metrics.

Task 2 – Customer Segmentation

Goal: Cluster customers into groups based on income and spending score.

Steps: Data preprocessing, scaling, apply K-Means, determine optimal clusters, visualize groupings.

Bonus: Try alternative clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN) and analyze cluster-level spending.

Dataset: Mall Customer Dataset (Kaggle).

Skills: Clustering, unsupervised learning.

Task 3 – Movie Recommendation System

Goal: Recommend movies to users based on similarity.

Steps: Build user-item matrix, compute similarity, generate top-rated unseen movie recommendations, evaluate using precision@K.

Bonus: Implement item-based collaborative filtering or matrix factorization (SVD).

Dataset: MovieLens 100K (Kaggle).

Skills: Recommendation systems, similarity-based modeling.

Task 4 – Sales Forecasting

Goal: Predict future sales using historical sales data.

Steps: Feature engineering (time-based features, lags), apply regression models, plot actual vs. predicted sales.

Bonus: Use rolling averages, seasonal decomposition, or advanced models (XGBoost/LightGBM).

Dataset: Walmart Sales Forecasting (Kaggle).

Skills: Time series forecasting, regression.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, (optionally TensorFlow/Keras, XGBoost, LightGBM)

Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab, Git
