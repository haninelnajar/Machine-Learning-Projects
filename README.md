## üìå Tasks  

### **Task 1 ‚Äì Student Score Prediction**  
- **Goal:** Predict students‚Äô exam scores based on study hours and related factors.  
- **Steps:** Data cleaning, visualization, train/test split, build linear regression model, evaluate performance.  
- **Bonus:** Apply polynomial regression and test feature combinations (e.g., sleep, participation).  
- **Dataset:** *Student Performance Factors* (Kaggle).  
- **Skills:** Regression, evaluation metrics.

### **Task 2 ‚Äì Customer Segmentation**  
- **Goal:** Cluster customers into groups based on income and spending score.  
- **Steps:** Data preprocessing, scaling, apply K-Means, determine optimal clusters, visualize groupings.  
- **Bonus:** Try alternative clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN) and analyze cluster-level spending.  
- **Dataset:** *Mall Customer Dataset* (Kaggle).  
- **Skills:** Clustering, unsupervised learning.

### **Task 3 ‚Äì Movie Recommendation System**  
- **Goal:** Recommend movies to users based on similarity.  
- **Steps:** Build user-item matrix, compute similarity, generate top-rated unseen movie recommendations, evaluate using precision@K.  
- **Bonus:** Implement item-based collaborative filtering or matrix factorization (SVD).  
- **Dataset:** *MovieLens 100K* (Kaggle).  
- **Skills:** Recommendation systems, similarity-based modeling.

### **Task 4 ‚Äì Sales Forecasting**  
- **Goal:** Predict future sales using historical sales data.  
- **Steps:** Feature engineering (time-based features, lags), apply regression models, plot actual vs. predicted sales.  
- **Bonus:** Use rolling averages, seasonal decomposition, or advanced models (XGBoost/LightGBM).  
- **Dataset:** *Walmart Sales Forecasting* (Kaggle).  
- **Skills:** Time series forecasting, regression.
